This application allows you to geolocate a location for a translated task
from [app-translate](https://github.com/citizen-cyberscience-centre/app-translate) applications.

**NOTE**: This application does not create any tasks, it does not use any
tutorial, etc. It builds on the [app-translate](https://github.com/citizen-cyberscience-centre/app-translate) task runs.

In order to import the tasks to this application, use the CSV importer
provided by PyBossa:

1. Export the [app-translate](https://github.com/citizen-cyberscience-centre/app-translatehttps://github.com/citizen-cyberscience-centre/app-translate) task runs as CSV
2. Import the CSV in the app-translate application.
